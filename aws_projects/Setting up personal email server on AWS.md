## These are my  notes based on my experience setting up personal email server on AWS
1. Create an Alternate User Account: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/managing-users.html
	1. To prevent entering a passowrd, Add, this line to the sudoers file, in the user privileges section:
		Vipin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
2. Associating an Elastic IP Address with a Running Instance: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html#using-instance-addressing-eips-associating
	1. When you associate an elastic IP address with an instance, the public IP address is released
3. Note that if you selected MariaDB, then you donâ€™t need password to log into MariaDB shell. Instead of running the normal command mysql -u root -p, you can run the following command to login, with sudo and without providing MariaDB root password.
		sudo mysql -u root
4. Error when restarting firewall: Review this
	1. [ INFO ] Updating ClamAV database (freshclam), please wait...<br/>
	ERROR: /var/log/clamav/freshclam.log is locked by another process<br/>
	It's safe to ignore, at this stage ClamAV daemon is not running, so freshclam can not talk to its socket to notify ClamAV to reload the virus signature database<br/>

5. In /etc/hosts, add both domain.com and the mail.domain.com
6. Check setting in security group
